# curtube

CurTube is a website / program similar to Youtube or the SFMG FYSC.

This will try to mimic how SFMG FYSC works (yes, I know how it work and Scratch FYSC also used the same thing (Like ratio and watch time))

## How it actually work (I guess):

You will login / signin in the first page (not finished yet), and then you will enter the dashboard which you can upload videos. The website SHOULD release in v1.1 .
